sentiment	review
1	"The Classic War of the Worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate H. G. Wells classic book.
0	This motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by George Miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films.
1	Its got a pretty good plot, some good action, and the change of location for Harry does not hurt either.
0	This movie could have been very good, but comes up way short; cheesy special effects and so-so acting.
0	It uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of "hot girls"; perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time.
1	This movie is a masterpiece.
1	His play, just as well as the play of Mr. Edwards is clearly the top of all their profession. I recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your DVD shelves.
1	While it is a bit heavy-handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip "a pilgrimage," this quiet film was the best evocation of "good will towards men" than I've seen in most holiday-themed TV movies.
0	Below average "horror" picture starts out clumsy, insulting, and inept, and continues that way for a while, with the absolute worst element being Midkiff's worthless performance.
0	The people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves.
1	This movie is one among the very few Indian movies, that would never fade away with the passage of time, nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish, even as the Indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the P.T. styled film songs.
1	I see Oscars somewhere here. A very fine film. If you have ever lost and felt alone, this film will assure you that you're not alone.
1	"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very persuasive even by today's standards. This film's quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary SF flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic.
1	Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and scope as our heroes tangle with an army of Thuggees. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his outstanding black & white cinematography.
0	I would love to have that two hours of my life back; don't Go, If you must see it, wait for the video ...
0	But that's a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie.
0	The rest of the actors... they don't deserve the term actors actually, are completely uninteresting. You're hoping they die a quick and painful death... and not only their characters
0	From a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films I have encountered absolutely dire.
0	Unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old, celebrated English film.
1	I liked the film. Its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies.
1	Mordantly funny, but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations, the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask: why aren't other films like this? one of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film.
1	The acting is superb, the characters are believably flawed, and the dialogue is sensitive. I highly recommend this movie
1	the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise. the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story, which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watch.
1	"Castle of Blood" is easily one of the best Italian "horror" movies made in early 60's.A masterpiece!
1	This is one of the best of many great Columbo installments.
0	It isn't just about a linguistic translation, but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely, robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap "oops there go my trousers" style of farce.
1	This film to be treasured and savoured. I enjoyed it much more than the much-hyped "Somersault". I'm glad I saw it.
0	This movie was absolutely awful. The acting was so terrible that I was just simply waiting and hoping for the God-awful thing to end.
1	I loved this movie. I just love the whole 80's genre of these kind of movies, because you don't see many like this one anymore!
1	By turns heart-breaking and uplifting, this film ranks with "Beautiful Thing" as must-see cinema.
1	With a wonderfully evocative score, and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest, this is a quiet gem, not world-class, but totally satisfying.
0	This is pretty bad. The play isn't great to begin with, and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours. - especially as that is intended to keep reminding you that you're watching a film, whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material.
0	What an absolutely crappy film this is. Strong advise for anyone DO NOT waste your time on this "film".
1	Their are many reasons the fact that it's set in new york which truly sets the tone, the fantastic soundtrack, the appealing star turns from Ben Gazzara, and the late John Ritter who is superb. The film is a light and breezy romantic comedy.
1	What a stunning episode for this fine series. This is television excellence at its best. Beautiful.
0	The biggest flaw is that it is so predictable, & that is the reason why I rated it so low. It's watchable but don't expect anything great.
1	Great movie, highly recommended.
1	Despite some very silly moments, it was very entertaining and fun--possibly as good or better than the first segment. Considering that the film started and ended so well, had excellent acting and writing, it's hard not to like this film.
0	This movie is pure trash! It's sickening. It's revolting. I don't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles.
1	Almost 20 years later Trick Or Treat is still one of my all time favorite movies.
0	IT IS so sad. Even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than other flicks.
0	A somewhat dull made for tv movie.
1	Soapdish is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again, because it's not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines. This is very well-crafted humor, almost all of it in the writing. Watch it and weep. A happy source for anyone's video addiction.
0	I was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable. The plot was weak to say the least. The rest of the film is complete and utter pants.
1	The King of Masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship. Summarily, it is an International Award winning art film which can't help but to move and inspire.
1	I can honestly say it was very interesting indeed. The two lead actors are awesome, the film isn't ever boring, and the concept behind it is really interesting. But I still think the movie is very well done and the director Ben Coccio deserves some credit.
0	How do I begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the worst film of all time by the worst director of all time? A film that could develop a cult following because it's so bad it's good?
0	I'm afraid this movie doesn't really have much going for it.
1	Bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy, teenaged niece on a year long "missionary trip" to Africa. Hilarious fun.
0	That betrayal is what hurts; but even without it, the fact remains that we don't like these characters, we feel embarrassed for the actors, the story is hopelessly muddled, and in the last analysis, we just don't care. Now, that really hurts.

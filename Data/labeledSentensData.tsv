sentiment	review
1	"The Classic War of the Worlds" by Timothy Hines is a very entertaining film that obviously goes to great effort and lengths to faithfully recreate H. G. Wells classic book.
0	This motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by George Miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films.
1	Its got a pretty good plot, some good action, and the change of location for Harry does not hurt either.
0	This movie could have been very good, but comes up way short; cheesy special effects and so-so acting.
0	It uses tired, bottom of the barrel comedic techniques - consistently breaking the fourth wall as Sandler talks to the audience, and seemingly pointless montages of "hot girls"; perhaps from his mouth he just vomited the worst film of all time.
1	This movie is a masterpiece.
1	His play, just as well as the play of Mr. Edwards is clearly the top of all their profession. I recommend this film to be on your top 50 films to see and keep on your DVD shelves.
1	While it is a bit heavy-handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip "a pilgrimage," this quiet film was the best evocation of "good will towards men" than I've seen in most holiday-themed TV movies.
0	Below average "horror" picture starts out clumsy, insulting, and inept, and continues that way for a while, with the absolute worst element being Midkiff's worthless performance.
0	The people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves.
1	This movie is one among the very few Indian movies, that would never fade away with the passage of time, nor would its spell binding appeal ever diminish, even as the Indian cinema transforms into the abyss of artificially styled pop culture while drill oriented extras take to enhancing the P.T. styled film songs.
1	I see Oscars somewhere here. A very fine film. If you have ever lost and felt alone, this film will assure you that you're not alone.
1	"Soylent Green" is one of the best and most disturbing science fiction movies of the 70's and still very persuasive even by today's standards. This film's quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary SF flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic.
1	Director George Stevens celebrates the spirit of adventure in grand style and scope as our heroes tangle with an army of Thuggees. Lenser Joseph H. August received an Oscar nomination for his outstanding black & white cinematography.
0	I would love to have that two hours of my life back; don't Go, If you must see it, wait for the video ...
0	But that's a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie.
0	The rest of the actors... they don't deserve the term actors actually, are completely uninteresting. You're hoping they die a quick and painful death... and not only their characters
0	From a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films I have encountered absolutely dire.
0	Unremarkable and unmemorable remake of an old, celebrated English film.
1	I liked the film. Its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies.
1	Mordantly funny, but also a bleak analysis of social and sexual relations, the film's great achievement is that it reflects real life in such a recognisable way as to make you ask: why aren't other films like this? one of the rare examples of a good book making an equally good film.
1	The acting is superb, the characters are believably flawed, and the dialogue is sensitive. I highly recommend this movie
1	the movie turned out to be a delightful and original surprise. the movie is surprisingly well constructed and has an unusual and original story, which also helps to make this movie a very pleasant one to watch.
1	"Castle of Blood" is easily one of the best Italian horror movies made in early 60's.A masterpiece!
1	This is one of the best of many great Columbo installments.
0	It isn't just about a linguistic translation, but certain absurd chains of events are skipped entirely, robbing the film of its original clever farcical nature and turning it into a cheap "oops there go my trousers" style of farce.
